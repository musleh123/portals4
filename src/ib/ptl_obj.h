 *
 * Common object type base class.
 *
 * This interface provides a base object class that
 * is used to hold all the a Portals objects.  Objects are managed
 * in pools which on demand create new objects in 'slabs'.
 *
 * The pool type is modeled loosely on the Linux kernel slab cache
 * data type which is widely used. It provides efficient allocation and
 * deallocation of fixed sized objects without fragmentation and allows
 * memory usage to grow as needed.
 *
 * Slabs are maintained in 'chunks' which are page sized arrays of
 * slab_info structs.
 *
 * And chunks are maintained in circular lists within pools. The
 * current design is very simple and only allows the object resources
 * in a pool to grow. Additional work would allow this design to
 * dynamically grow and shrink the amount of memory used in a given
 * pool.
 *
 * Pools are designed to allow an object to 'own' pools of other objects
 * in a heirarchy. All objects eventually belong to an NI which is the
 * root of Portals4 resources.
 *
 * Each base object has a handle assigned which can be used to lookup
 * the object. The handle includes an object type and an index into
 * an array of object pointers.
 *
 * Each base object also has a reference count that is used to handle
 * object cleanup. When an object is allocated its ref count is set to 1.
 * Other objects or code that depends on being able to reference the
 * object can take additional references to the object and free them
 * when done. When the final reference is dropped the object is cleaned
 * up and put back on the pool freelist.
